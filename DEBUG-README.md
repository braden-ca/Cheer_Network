# Comprehensive Debugging Suite

This debugging suite provides comprehensive testing and validation for all the new features and enhancements added to the Cheer Network application.

## Overview

The debugging suite consists of multiple specialized debuggers that test different aspects of the system:

### 🔧 Debug Components

1. **Master Debugger** (`debug-master.js`) - Runs all debugging suites and provides comprehensive analysis
2. **Database Debugger** (`debug-database.js`) - Tests database schema, RLS policies, and operations
3. **Upload Debugger** (`debug-upload.js`) - Tests file upload system and directory structure
4. **Comprehensive Debugger** (`debug-comprehensive.js`) - Tests backend APIs and integrations
5. **Frontend Debugger** (`debug-frontend.js`) - Tests frontend components and validation

## Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
node debug-master.js
```

### Run Individual Tests
```bash
# Database only
node debug-database.js

# Upload system only
node debug-upload.js

# Backend APIs only
node debug-comprehensive.js

# Frontend only (in browser)
node debug-frontend.js
```

### Run Specific Components
```bash
# Test specific backend components
node debug-comprehensive.js database
node debug-comprehensive.js api
node debug-comprehensive.js rls
node debug-comprehensive.js lookup
node debug-comprehensive.js upload
```

- ✅ `/api/upload/profile-picture` - File upload
- ✅ `/api/users/clinicians` - Enhanced clinician listing

## Output and Reports

### Console Output
Each debugger provides real-time console output with:
- ✅ Success indicators for passing tests
- ❌ Error indicators for failing tests
- 📊 Statistics and summaries
- 🎯 Actionable recommendations

### Generated Files
- `debug-master-report-[timestamp].json` - Comprehensive JSON report
- `debug-summary.txt` - Text summary of all tests
- `debug-report.json` - Individual component reports

### Health Assessment
The system provides overall health ratings:
- 🎉 **EXCELLENT** (90%+ success rate)
- ✅ **GOOD** (70-89% success rate)
- ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION** (50-69% success rate)
- ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES** (<50% success rate)

## Prerequisites

### Required Packages
```bash
npm install node-fetch form-data
```

### Environment Setup
- `.env` file with database credentials
- Server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Database accessible via Supabase

### Required Directories
```
public/
  uploads/
    profiles/
```

## Browser Testing

For frontend testing, you can:

1. **Automatic Testing**: Load any page with `?debug=true` parameter
2. **Manual Testing**: Open browser console and run:
   ```javascript
   const debugger = new FrontendDebugger();
   debugger.runAll().then(report => console.log(report));
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server Not Running**
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**Database Connection Issues**
- Check `.env` file for correct Supabase credentials
- Verify database is accessible
- Check RLS policies are properly configured

**File Upload Issues**
- Ensure `public/uploads/profiles/` directory exists
- Check directory permissions
- Verify multer is installed: `npm install multer @types/multer`

**Missing Dependencies**
```bash
npm install node-fetch form-data multer @types/multer
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Deployment
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
node debug-master.js

# Check specific components
node debug-database.js
node debug-upload.js
```

### During Development
```bash
# Quick API tests
node debug-comprehensive.js api

# Database schema validation
node debug-comprehensive.js database
```

### Continuous Monitoring
- Add debug scripts to your CI/CD pipeline
- Run tests after database migrations
- Validate after major feature additions

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Scenarios
You can extend the debuggers by adding custom test cases:

```javascript
// Add to any debugger class
async testCustomScenario() {
  this.log('Testing custom scenario...');
  // Your test logic here
}
```

### Selective Testing
```bash
# Test only specific endpoints
node debug-comprehensive.js api

# Test only database structure
node debug-comprehensive.js database
```

## Support

If you encounter issues with the debugging suite:

1. Check that all prerequisites are met
2. Verify server is running and accessible
3. Check console output for specific error messages
4. Review generated report files for detailed analysis
5. Run individual debuggers to isolate issues

The debugging suite is designed to be comprehensive and help identify issues quickly during development and deployment of the enhanced Cheer Network features.
